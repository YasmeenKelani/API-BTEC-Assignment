# Explain API types
* Public, partner, private, and composite APIs are the four most prevalent forms of API used in web-based applications. The API's "type" shows the intended scope of use in this case.

1. **Public APIs :** A public API can be used by any outside developer or business because it is open and accessible. A business plan for a company that develops and sells a public API will entail sharing its apps and data with other companies.
Authentication and authorisation are usually moderate in public APIs. An organization may also try to monetize the API by charging a per-call fee to use the public API.

2. **Partner APIs :** A partner API is a tool for facilitating business-to-business transactions that is only available to a small group of outside developers or API consumers. For example, if a company wishes to share customer data selectively with outside CRM businesses, it can utilize a partner API to connect the internal customer data system with those external partners — no other API use is allowed.
Partners with particular rights and licenses have access to these APIs. As a result, partner APIs typically include more robust authentication, authorisation, and security features. In addition, most businesses do not directly monetize APIs; rather, partners are compensated for their services, not for API usage.

3. **Internal APIs :** An internal (or private) API is designed to connect systems and data within the company. An internal API, for example, might link an organization's payroll and HR systems.
Because internal APIs are meant for internal usage, and such security levels are presumed to be in place through other policies, they typically have minimal security and authentication — or none at all. This is changing, however, as organizations' API strategies are more influenced by increased threat awareness and regulatory compliance requirements.

4. **Composite APIs :** Composite APIs are made up of two or more APIs that work together to create a series of connected or interdependent activities. Composite APIs can be useful for addressing complex or closely linked API behaviors, and they can occasionally outperform individual APIs in terms of speed and performance.

## Benefits of APIs:

1. Increases productivity.
2. Save costs.
3. Improves connectivity and collaboration.
4. Encourages innovation.
5. Enhances customer experience.
6. Improves marketing.
7. Collects data for intelligence analytics.
8. Creats new revenue opportunities.
9. Builds new product capabilities.

## Analyze the differences between API and SDK:

**what is APIs ?** 

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of commands that allows your application to interface with an external service. To decipher the name, the "Interface" refers to the point at which various software components can communicate with one another. Developers can add unique functionalities to their applications and speed up the development process by using an API.
Many applications, for example, employ a payment processing API rather than investing time and resources in developing their own payment processing infrastructure.

**What is an SDK ?**

An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is a set of tools, guidelines, and programs for developing software on a specific platform. An SDK is a software development kit, as the name suggests. APIs (or several APIs), IDEs, Documentation, Libraries, Code Samples, and other utilities can all be found in SDKs. SDKs have a number of powerful features and functionalities that make developing programs and apps easier.
In some cases, having an SDK is essential. To create iOS applications, for example, you'll need the iOS SDK.

**What is the difference between an API and SDK ?**

 APIs and SDKs are so similar, it can be difficult to tell the difference between the two and when you should use one over the other. Another cause of ambiguity is the fact that SDKs frequently include one or more APIs and assist in their implementation. However, an SDK is not necessarily available with an API.
 An SDK is an integrated platform that boasts a set of tools to construct these applications, whereas an API is purpose-built to serve a specific role of facilitating connection between applications. APIs make it easier for apps to communicate with one another, but they aren't enough to establish a new app. In other words, if you're trying to add a few specific functionality to your product, an API might be a better option. If you're launching a brand-new project, an SDK will give you the tools you need to get started.

**Summary**

The fundamental distinction is that an API is essentially just a service's interface, but an SDK is a collection of tools, components, and code fragments built for a specific purpose.
APIs and SDKs are similar, yet they each have their own set of features and benefits. Understanding the distinctions might assist you in deciding which is the best option for your project. The key distinctions between an API and an SDK are summarized in the diagram below.
